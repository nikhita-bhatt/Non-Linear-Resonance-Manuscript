However, the random nature is in contrast to the common assumption that the brain is not a noise generator but a sophisticated information processor. It is dynamic nature is (by and large) at present not understood and thus an important application for dynamical systems theory. \n"

A major focus is to decide whether some unusual feature is relevant or an unwanted recording artifact. Conclusions made without proper training in this area are often useless. \n",
